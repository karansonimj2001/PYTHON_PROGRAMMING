    #we can easily perform searching & sorting
    #we can also perform aggregate operaions easily
        #count,min,max,sum,avg,etc.
    #dynamic in size
    #iterables(we can fetch values using for one by one)
    #it is highly recommended to put simlar type values

    >tuple
    >set
    >frozenset
    >dict
    etc.

#List
    >duplicate value are allowed
    >supports indexing and slicing
